# Day 20: Pulse Propagation
## Part 1: Product of pulse counts
- Mostly straight-forward, almost only problems because of Rust, took some time to get algorithm running.
## Part 2: Button press count to activate rx
- Just let the programm running did not reach an end result.
- It seems, some acceleration is needed.
- It ssems that basically some hardware adder is replicated in software, to solve the task fast it might be required to determine the strong components in the graph, might be possible to faster solve this parts (i.e. solving means computing how long it takes for the required outputs), and combine these partial results.
